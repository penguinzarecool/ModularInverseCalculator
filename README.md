# ModularInverseCalculator
This project finds the modular inverse of 2 numbers. It's written in C. After you compile it, usage is as follows: ./[executable] [a] [b] where a and be are a % b. It finds the modular inverse of a. I spent a lot of time on this so if you like it let me know, and if you have problems with it let me know.
